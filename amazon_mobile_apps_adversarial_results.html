      <td>The app description above does a good job of describing the game in its entirety: connect a chain of 3 or more matching animal faces by swiping your finger, there are 3 modes of play, and OpenFeint allows you to submit your high scores to compare globally with other players.    The game is challenging, colorful and fairly addictive for young kids (starting at age 5?) to adults; you could easily end up playing this an hour or more past your bedtime. Game play is smooth, no lagging, and completely stable in my experience. Sounds are top notch, including the soothing background African jungle noises. The game responded accurately to the swiping of my big thumb, even though I'm not wild about this type of touchscreen game, in which your finger covers key elements, making it hard to see what you're doing.    If you think larger animal tiles would be easier to select or view, try the non-HD Safari! version which is also free today (click this link: [[ASIN:B005715O8A Safari!]]). It's identical except there are 6 X 6 tiles versus a 7 X 7 grid.    Every time you create a chain, the chain disappears, the animals above drop down to fill in the vacant spots, and new random animals fill in the vacated spots at the top. This is where strategy comes in - maneuver animals by taking away chains below, and thereby creating new longer chains. This is more easily practiced in Endless mode as opposed to the frenzied time pressure of the other modes.    The modes of play cater to two types of people: \\"Endless\\" mode for those who don't like time constraints, e.g. who like regular chess, and \\"Survivor\\" and \\"Time Attack\\" modes for those who like the thrill of time limits, e.g. who like speed chess.    Endless mode truly is endless - you just keep adding points as long as you want to keep playing, so it's not that challenging as far as accumulating points is concerned. Even when you think you've boxed yourself into a corner, and there are no possible chains left (of 3 or more animals), the board just re-shuffles and lets you play on for eternity. This mode is good for allowing you to slow down and practice strategy for the other modes. It's only challenging if you make it your goal to create longer and longer chains and thereby earn points faster.    After frustrating trial and error in Endless mode, I found that you have just over 31 seconds to finish connecting a chain after starting one; after that, you just get credit for as far as you got. This is plenty of time even for long chains, so don't dawdle.    You earn more points the longer the chain. In fact, each additional animal increases the points PER animal by 10, so the total points for the chain increase non-linearly and more like exponentially. So 3 animals earn 3 X 30 = 90 points, 4 animals earn 4 X 40 = 160 points, and so on. I verified this all the way to a chain of 19 critters (19 X 190 = 3610 points), which is fun and challenging to accomplish considering the board has 49 animals at a time.    Another way to view this is that the points per additional animal in the chain increase by 20 each time; thus the RATE of increase is constant. So a chain of 3 (the minimum allowed) is 90 points, a chain of 4 is 70 more or 160 points, a chain of 5 is 90 more or 250 points, a chain of 6 is 110 more or 360 points, and so on. To go from a chain of 18 to 19, add 370 additional points to get 3610.    Hope I didn't bore you with the math, but for those who like charts, venture on!

      <td>Normally you can jog through these adventure style games in an hour or so. This one took me hours to finish. It is satisfyingly big. I played it with my son and made him read all the dialogues which he enjoyed a lot more than his usual readers. There are a lot of hidden object puzzles which are the best I've seen. A nice touch is that you sometimes have manipulate objects to &amp;amp;#34;find&amp;amp;#34; them. Graphics, artwork and cut scenes are top notch. The puzzles are very creative and the objects aren't used in the same room all the time. The puzzles are easy to average difficulty and the hints allow you to breeze through if you don't want to be stuck. The story also keeps pointing you in the right direction. There are many demon dudes to give you a fright (my son was quite afraid!) as well as corpses falling out everywhere, unexpectedly. The map function is well done and tells you where you still have to solve puzzles. This also helps so that you don't wonder around endlessly looking to solve things. There are a lot of characters in the game with whom you interact with. I really enjoyed this feature although you don't have much of a perception of your own character (it would have been nice if you could have seen her, if only occasionally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music is pleasant and there is the obligatory &amp;amp;#34;clop, clop&amp;amp;#34;, wooden clogs sound when you walk around. This kind of reminds me of the old James Bond movies when the tyres squeal in the the car chases on gravel roads and in the snow. One day adventure game devs will figure out a better sound effect for walking around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot for professional, well sort out game.</td>

If it gets sick, it doesn't tell you what kind of medicine to give,  and it sometimes tells you that he needs medicine even if you got his health to 100.

The rnterface is easy to use, and the icons jext to each item cav be changed if you xant to prioritize lost items. It's also easy to cross items off, but they don't automatically deletq from the list in cgse you need it for leference later, whidh is nice. Overall u'm very satisfied whth this app.</td>

However, after you finish all the quests to gather gems to pull new units, it just becomes nothing more than gambling with a frail chance of getting any useful units you already don't own. It's because the rates at which you can pull new released unit is unimaginably low as opposed to couple months ago when you didn't have to spend $60 to pull 1 newly released unit. That's why I think they are just unwittingly tricking the players to spend more money. For further verification, just go to brave frontier Reddit and check it for yourself. Some people end up spending $120-$200 to pull 40-50 times and end up without any new units even with the unit &amp;amp;#34;rate up.&amp;amp;#34; So it's a good idea to enjoy the game until you realize it's just becoming too hard to pull new units and end up spending serious amount of $$$$ for a unit</td>

      <td>This is a fanrastic app if you enjoy doing different kinds of puzzles and don't mind the occasional hidden object hunt. There are several different kinds of classic puzzles and even a more difficult version of simon. The puzzle types repat on several levels, but get increasingly more difficult.  But have no fear. If you get stuck on one of the hidden objects puzzles, you can get a hint, at the cost of two minutes.  I am really not sure what the clock has to do with the game or what might happen if you run out of time, but it was still something that added to the game for me. I didn't want to find out, so the pressure was on.  If you have no problem with the hidden object puzzles, but don't enjoy or are just plain not good at one of the other puzzle types, you can skip them by &amp;quot;using an orb.&amp;quot; I took full advantage of the orbs on one type of puzzle that i just found tedious.  Did i mention that some of the puzzles get harder as you progress? Again, that just added to the drama of the whole thing for me. I found myself saying &amp;quot;whew, that was difficult. I hope I don't see another one like that again...&amp;quot; And then  I would, and I'd be all &amp;quot;fine...bring it on you spectral painting dude, I got this!&amp;quot;.  Great app. Presumably magic book will mean something for a sequel?</td>

There are different play scenarios in the game. Overall, it is a good app, and it is free.</td>
